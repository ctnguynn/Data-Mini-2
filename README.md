# Data-Mini-2

Welcome to Data Mini #2! You and your teammates will have [TIME] to explore and prepare a presentation about your data analysis. The hour after will be spent presenting your findings.

This Git repository contains this README file and the dataset in both CSV and RDS formats. This README will include the dataset's dictionary, along with the rubric and policies. The CSV and the RDS have the same rows and columns, but the RDS will preserve R data types exactly (factors, dates, lists, etc.). We recommend you use Duke's Container Manager to access your preferred IDE.

How to Participate

Fork the repository emailed to you by trisha.iyer@duke.edu
Load the data.
Come up with a question to answer with data analysis. Analyze the dataset and prepare a presentation of your findings.
AFTER ANALYZING TIMEFRAME: Submit your presentation slides and video, including the forked repository link, to the Google Drive so we can screenshare it. Please do not attempt to push changes to this repository - it is read-only for participants.

Data Variables

Competition Policies
Code of Conduct
AI and Online Sources

AI tools and online resources are permitted with proper citations
Include citations for forums (Stack Overflow), textbooks, and other references
Provide a link to any AI chat conversations used
You must list all citations (including the original study’s citation found at the bottom of this README) at the end of your code notebook

Code Reuse

You may reuse code from your own research or class projects
You may NOT copy from the original student-teacher race match study - doing so will result in a major point deduction

Analysis

Must answer a question that your team chooses
All types of data modeling are allowed
All coding languages are allowed

Submission Requirements

After a one-hour information session on Feb. 27th from 5:30-6:30 pm in Old Chem 001, you and your team will have until Mar. 1 at 11:59 pm to submit materials and a video recording of findings to a Google Drive folder. Please contact Chelsea Nguyen (chelsea.nguyen@duke.edu) with any questions!

Presentation Video Guidelines
    Present using any format: Quarto doc, slides, visualizations, etc: Your chosen presentation media will be projected by an SSMU member through your Google Drive
    Presentations will be recorded during the event.
    Recordings will be sent to you and your teammates a few days following the event
    SSMU would love to share your presentation recording with QSIDE and the original dataset creators! The dataset and study were created by previous undergraduate students at Williams College in 2023. If you would like to opt into this opportunity, please let us know!
    Presentation order will be randomized, but let us know beforehand if your team has a preference for going first, last, or in the middle

Judging

Winners will be announced on Sunday, February 15
As stated earlier, you must come up with a question that your team will use to guide your statistical analysis.
A fair evaluation will be justified by multiple people deciding on competition winners.
The judging criteria is as follows:
    Communication: Clarity of presentation, logical structure, and ability to explain findings to a broad audience. - 20%
    Creativity & Insight: Depth of analysis, creativity in approach, and ability to identify meaningful patterns. - 40%
    Reproducibility: Well-organized code, clear documentation, and transparent workflows. - 5%
    Visualization & Design: Effective use of charts and visuals to support your conclusions. - 25%
    Technical Soundness: Appropriate use of statistical methods, reasonable assumptions, and valid interpretations. - 10%
This will be prioritized more than the experience level of the statistical methods your team members used. This will account for differing experience levels across competitors.

Other Competitions from SSMU

ASA DataFest 2026 at Duke, organized by the Department of Statistical Science, will take place in Perkins Library on Duke University West Campus, Friday, March 20, through Sunday, March 22. Similar to Data Minis, DataFest is a data analysis competition where teams of up to five students attack a large, complex, and surprise data set over a weekend. Please reach out to Dr. Alexander Fisher (alexander.fisher@duke.edu) with any questions.
